This simple calculator web application allows you to perform basic calculations. Here are some recent revisions and fixes:

## Recent Revisions and Fixes

### Added Navigation Link Styles
- Improved the user experience by adding navigation link styles that indicate the current active page. Now, when you navigate through the app, you'll see a visual indicator of the page you're on.

### Fixed Dark Theme Issue
- Resolved an issue where changing the page in dark theme mode didn't apply the active navigation link styling after navigating back to the index. 

### Introduced 'calculatorState' File
- Added a new 'calculatorState' file that includes functions to save the current state of the calculator and ‘Running Total’. Now, when you navigate away from the index page and return, the calculator state is preserved.
